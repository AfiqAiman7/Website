	      <h2>MY INTROVERT HOBBY</h2>
	      <p>Since I was a child, I've always enjoyed playing games. I don't care what type of game it is, whether it is idle, rpg, or pay4win, as long as it piques my interest, I will play it. It also allowed me to see in a competitive and passionate world. Playing video games relieves my tension and calms me after a long and exhausting day at school. So, what's better than finding something that fuels your ambition to be the best at something that roughly half of the human population participates in.</p>

	      <p class="work-heading">ROLE PLAYING GAME(RPG)</p>
	      <p class="work-text">A role-playing game (often known as a RPG) is a game in which players take on the roles of characters in a fictional scenario. Players are responsible for carrying out these roles in a story, either through literal acting or through a process of controlled character development decision-making. This is the type of game that piques my interest by requiring me to engage in and accomplish all of the missions. Example of the game like Dragon Fable.</p>

	      <p class="work-heading">IDLE</p>
	      <p class="work-text">Incremental games (also known as idle games, clicker games, or clicking games) are video games in which the player earns currency by repeating simple tasks such clicking on the screen. This is the type of game that relaxes my mind because it requires few activities to complete one mission. This game can be utilised to get goods or skills that speed up the accumulation of cash. Examples of the games like Idle Heroes, Idle Mining Empire, and Grass Farm Idle.</p>

	      <p class="work-heading">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER(FPS)</p>
	      <p class="work-text">A first-person shooter (FPS) is a type of action video game in which the player controls the protagonist. FPS games usually track the player's movements and show what a real person would see and do in the game. This is the type of game that provides me with a competitive mode in which I (myself) will compete against other players to win the match. Example of the game like Valorant.</p>
